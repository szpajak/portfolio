# Spam Filter Project

This project is a spam filter that uses machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or non-spam. It aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted spam emails, improving the user's email experience.

## Features

- **Training the model**: The project provides a mechanism to train the spam filter model using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can be used to predict whether a given email is spam or not.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/szpajak/NLP_Spam_Detector.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Collect a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
2. **Train the model**: Run the training script to train the spam filter model using the dataset.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Use the evaluation script to assess the model's performance.
4. **Predict spam emails**: Apply the trained model to classify new emails as spam or non-spam.
