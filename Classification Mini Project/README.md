# Multiclass Classification with Neural Networks

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for multiclass classification using TensorFlow. Unlike binary classification, where the goal is to classify data points into two classes, multiclass classification deals with scenarios where multiple classes are present.

## Overview

In this repository, we leverage TensorFlow's Fashion MNIST dataset, specifically designed for multiclass classification tasks, to showcase the implementation of a neural network model.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each image belongs to one of the following 10 classes:

1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

The goal is to train a neural network that can accurately classify these clothing items into their respective categories.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model used in this repository consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The architecture is designed to handle the complexity of the Fashion MNIST dataset and make accurate predictions for multiclass classification.
